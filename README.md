# Learning Python

I'm a Software Engineer who comes from a background in education with over a decade of experience teaching Math and Computer Science. My educational philosophy and methods have been highly influenced by the Stanford CS106A course along with my time teaching for Art of Problem Solving. I hope you enjoy this site. It's been a labor of love.
